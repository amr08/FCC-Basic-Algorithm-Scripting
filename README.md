### Basic Algorithmic Challenges

#### Some people are awesome at algorithms.  I am not one of those wizards.  For me, algorithms are a "use it or lose it" type of skill that I have to make effort to brush up on when given the opportunity. I had some time to run through FreeCodeCamp's basic challenges earlier this week and decided they were worthy enough to post.
>Titles with * are the ones I found to be the most challenging which I flagged to revisit sometime.

FreeCodeCamp has been such a great resource for practicing code over the years.  Whenever anyone asks me about resources for learning how to code, I always point them there first.  I love revisiting the site from time to time to try to get through some of their curriculum as it is always evolving with the field!
